## IOTEX Test Task Submission

### Features:
- Search images from Flickr API
- Show loader while images are being fetched
- Basic styling

### TBA (To Be Added for prod ready):
- Unit tests
- UI Library like antd or material-ui
- Better error handling and error boundaries
- Never check-in API keys also [shouldn't use .env with plain text secrets](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/) as they are bundled with the React APP. Use a backend server for secrets always.
- May be use a CSS pre-processer like SASS or LESS for consistent styling with the help of variables, etc.
